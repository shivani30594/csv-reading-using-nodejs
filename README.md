# csv-reading-using-nodejs

This is the small project which will read the CSV file from the documents and process it using the node js. To display the content of the 
CSV file I have used the EJS templete

Steps:

## npm install

NOTE:

If you want to change the CSV file then you can refer to the Documents folder. Change the name of the file into the index.js file.
